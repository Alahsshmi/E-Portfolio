Case Study: ACM Case on "Inadvertent Disclosure of Sensitive Data"<br><br>
In this ACM case, an application that had not been thoroughly tested was pushed and, along with it, sensitive customer information was exposed by a software engineer blunder. This raises issues under ACM Code of Ethics (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018) as it concerns “Privacy” and in principle 1.6 states: “Respect privacy” and” Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks” which is Principle 2.5. In this case, the primary ethical failure is the lack of proper personal data custodianship.
Legally, such an incident may breach the UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), both of which require organisations to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data (Cumbley and Church, 2013).  Imposing these regulations exposes the organization to significant financial penalties and reputational damage. From a socio-ethical perspective, customer trust and public confidence in digital systems may become detrimental.
The BCS Code of Conduct (British Computer Society, 2015) offers a parallel framework. It draws attention to the public interest protection (Clause 1) as well as the maintenance of competence and integrity (Clause 2). In this instance, both were neglected. Deficient care as shown by the engineer's actions which breach professional standards.
This case highlights sharp focus violation of ethical foresight along with testing robust processes within software development. Following and respecting both ACM and BCS codes guarantees computing professionals meet their societal and professional obligations.<br><br>

	1- Peer Response to Jasim Alzaabi<br>
 Thank you, Jasim, for your enlightening inquiry into the “Malicious Inputs to Content Filters” case. Your post clearly shows how systems designed to benefit the public can be exploited if there is no foresight in the development processes.
 To avoid such ethical and legal shortcomings, one primary measure could have been using proactive moderation strategies— like the combination of automated flagging and human review. The unrestrained soliciting of user-generated feedback in sensitive environments such as libraries and the impact it has on their machine learning systems is dangerous. Without some form of feedback verification, the risk is heightened (Boyarskaya et al., 2020).
 Another essential measure is the introduction of so-called bias checkers and fairness audits at all stages of system development. Raji et al. 2020 showed that these tools enable developers to identify and mitigate negative impacts on marginalized groups before system deployment, reinforcing both ACM and BCS codes.
 Accountability and GDPR's proactive transparency principles alongside strengthening public trust demand unreserved enforcement through revealing algorithms utilized by Blocker Plus’s developers and offering trusted ways to appeal blocked content. It is not enough to only foster public trust; lawmakers demand fundamental principles revealed through Veale & Edwards (2018).
 As your post accurately highlights, ethical foresight is not a choice to make—it is necessary for AI systems that engage with the public. This example highlights the need for AI governance to include legal structure, design constraints, and holistic safeguards for the public good.

 <br><br>2- Peer Response to Craig Norris<br>
 Thanks, Craig, for the precise and well-reasoned explanation of the Malware Disruption case. Your post sorely highlights Rogue Services’ inaction as a breach of professional ethical boundaries and the resulting sociotechnical damage.
 Services like Rogue must adopt a structured governance approach that features automatic malware and suspicious traffic detection and takedown systems. As pointed out by Li et al. (2019), automated systems that employ behavioural and AI analysis greatly mitigate the hosting and proliferation of malicious content.
 In addition, segmentation-addition of cybersecurity compliance requirements as part of the company’s internal policy manual is crucial too. Compliance frameworks like NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework or ISO/IEC 27001 should be followed by host service providers for compliant legal and ethical governance (NIST, 2018). It is one thing to avoid liability, but even more important is to protect users and safeguard public trust towards digital infrastructures.
 Lastly, ethical anticipatory governance should be formalized and integrated through routine corporate reporting and staff training sessions. Floridi and Cowls (2019) make the case that embedding ethics within the technical life cycle—design to deployment—aligns decisions with public interest.
 Your analysis clearly portrays that the negligence from a service provider has implications that extend far beyond the provider’s operational boundaries.
 Every responsible digital service provider will always adhere to ethical responsibility, maintain technological surveillance, obey legal standards, and comply with regulations.

 <br><br>3- Response to Martyna Antas<br>
 Thank you, Martyna, for your thoughtful and well-referenced discussion of the Corazón case. You’ve rightly highlighted the company’s strong ethical stance, especially in prioritising privacy, regulatory compliance, and social inclusion. It’s refreshing to analyse a case that presents a positive example of ethical computing practice—while still acknowledging areas for improvement.
 The lack of security you mention also addresses a critical point: compliance does not equal safety. While it is commendable that Corazon worked together with the researcher, greater passive risk mitigation measures could have made it so that the vulnerability was not able to be deployed in the first place. Ethical design, as Sedenberg and Hoffmann (2016) point out, “anticipatory governance” conduct scrutiny of potential exploitation weaknesses prior to systems being put into operation, especially in life-dependent systems.
 Furthermore, Corazon could routinely employ external pen testers and implement IoT security frameworks like OWASP to better manage risk from sensitive health data they possess. This also supports Article 32 of the GDPR alongside ENISA (2021) that speaks of adequate technical and organizational indications of safeguards).
 Finally, your argument regarding policy gaps is equally important. One does not need to breach a policy to be held responsible and liable in emerging technologies spaces. A responsible and ethical approach should have consideration for risky situations without legislation being prepared. This attitude must be adopted in other processes from all health techs in development.
 Outstanding breakdown of a complicated yet significant subject.

<b>Summary Post</b><br><br>
The ACM case discussion, “Inadvertent Disclosure of Sensitive Data,” brings to the forefront profound ethical and legal implications for software engineering. In my prior post, I highlighted the breaches of Privacy Violations Principles 1.6 and 2.5, which stress privacy and risk assessment (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). I also highlighted the requirements set by the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, as well as GDPR, about organizational safeguards and the consequences of failing to put such safeguards, highlighting the significant penalties that can be imposed and damage to reputation (Cumbley and Church, 2013).
This peer feedback has helped to broaden my understanding. Norris (2025) argued that software releases without sufficient testing damage public trust, which further emphasizes that ethical wrongdoing can lead to severe consequences beyond financial burden (Buttrick, Davidson and McGowan, 2016). Alzaabi (2025) provided a counterpoint by accepting the engineer’s guilt but simultaneously urged an analysis of the broader systemic organisational culture and ethics surrounding it. Alharthi (2025) voiced the same concerns regarding erosion of trust towards information systems and emphasized that ethical considerations need to be integrated throughout the entire development process, not just towards the end.
There is a unified agreement and understanding that ethical responsibility is within a group. Developers, teams, and the leadership must construct an ecosystem that encourages ethical anticipation and thorough vetting during every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Following ACM and BCS codes mean not only abiding legislation but casting strengthening faith to the society in technologies and its developers.
